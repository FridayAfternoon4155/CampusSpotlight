# Welcome to Campus Spotlight!

Campus Spotlight aims to provide users with a platform to keep up with upcoming events happening at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
The idea behind this application arose from the need for a one-stop platform which organized a wide range of events occurring throughout the year at the University. Currently, event notifications cone in the form of emails which get lost amongst the countless emails students receive on a daily basis, or flyers posted on campus.
Students are unable to see important class emails when they are bombarded with campus event emails. Half the time, students are disregarding event emails and the attendance is low. This could all be fixed with this app.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/FridayAfternoon4155/UNCCEventsApp/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
